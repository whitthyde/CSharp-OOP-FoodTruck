# CSharp-OOP-FoodTruck
Built an object based console app for a food truck. A worker can use the application to order the items, and a calculated receipt will be sent to the customer.

This project was done as a homework assignment. Please do not underestimate the effort of this project due to its tag as homework. The assignment was a very thorough one, intended to demonstrate my object oriented programing skills in 'C#'

Thank you, and once again feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
